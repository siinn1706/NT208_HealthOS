## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

#### User-Configurable BMI/Weight Goals (end-to-end)

- **BE Layer** (`backend/app/`)
  - `models/health_goal.py` — SQLAlchemy model for `user_bmi_goals` table (separate from activity `user_health_goals`); stores only `target_weight_kg` + `current_height_cm` (BMI always derived)
  - `schemas/health_goal.py` — Pydantic schemas requiring at least one of `target_weight_kg`/`current_height_cm`; deadline ≥ today
  - `services/health_goal.py` — CRUD service with ownership checks
  - `api/v1/endpoints/health_goals.py` — CRUD endpoints: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE at `/v1/health-goals`
  - Migration `011_add_bmi_weight_goals.py` — creates `user_bmi_goals` table

- **BFF Layer** (`frontend/src/app/api/v1/`)
  - `health-goals/route.ts` — GET + POST (with per-user Redis cache keyed by JWT-decoded userId)
  - `health-goals/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH + DELETE

- **FE Data Layer** (`frontend/src/`)
  - `lib/api-client.ts` — client-safe `bffFetchClient()` for `"use client"` components
  - `lib/gamification-data.ts` — `getUserBmiData()` fetches `/api/v1/health-goals` + `/api/v1/analytics/gamification-summary` in parallel; `targetBmi` always derived from `target_weight_kg / (height_cm/100)²`

- **FE UI Layer** (`frontend/src/`)
  - `components/dashboard/progress/HealthGoalDialog.tsx` — react-hook-form dialog with only target height + target weight inputs; BMI auto-calculated (read-only) + healthy-weight recommendation hint under each input (BMI=22 ideal)
  - `components/dashboard/progress/ProgressPageClient.tsx` — client component wrapping stat cards + chart + dialog
  - `app/[locale]/(app)/dashboard/progress/page.tsx` — hybrid Server Component fetches `bmiData` + `weightHistory` in parallel, passes to `ProgressPageClient`

- **i18n**: All progress dialog labels (`setGoal`, `editGoal`, `deadline`, `targetHeight`, `targetWeight`, `bmi`, `bmiAutoHint`, `recWeight`, `recHeight`, etc.) added to `vi.json` and `en.json`
